Certainly! The flow for adding a new user involves multiple steps across the registration-service and auth-service. Below is a step-by-step guide for the entire flow:

Flow for Adding a New User:
Client Makes a Request:

The client (e.g., a frontend application or another microservice) sends a request to the registration-service to add a new user.
Registration Service Onboards User:

The RegistrationController in the registration-service receives the request to add a new user.
The RegistrationController invokes the RegistrationService to onboard the user.
The RegistrationService performs any necessary validation and onboards the user by saving the user details (e.g., username and password) to its data store (e.g., database).
Registration Service Communicates with Auth Service:

After onboarding the user, the RegistrationService makes an HTTP request to the auth-service to register the user for authentication and authorization purposes.
The RegistrationService sends a request to the AuthController in the auth-service, passing the necessary user details (e.g., username and password).
Auth Service Registers User:

The AuthController in the auth-service receives the registration request.
The AuthService in the auth-service performs any necessary validation.
The AuthService creates an AuthUser entity (representing the user for authentication and authorization) and saves it to its data store.
The AuthService generates a JWT token for the user.
Registration Service Receives Token:

The RegistrationService in the registration-service receives the JWT token from the auth-service after a successful registration.
Registration Service Responds to Client:

The RegistrationService responds to the client with the JWT token or an appropriate message indicating that the user has been successfully registered.
Summary of Microservice Responsibilities:
registration-service:

Handles user onboarding and basic user details.
Communicates with the auth-service to register the user for authentication and authorization.
auth-service:

Manages authentication and authorization.
Registers users for authentication and generates JWT tokens.
Validates user credentials during login.
Notes:
The communication between microservices can be achieved through RESTful API calls, typically using HTTP.
The token generated by the auth-service can be used by the client for subsequent authenticated requests.
Error handling and validation should be implemented at various steps to ensure a secure and reliable flow.
Consider using secure practices such as password hashing, HTTPS, and JWT best practices for token generation and validation.
This flow provides a basic outline, and you may need to adapt it based on your specific requirements and the technologies you are using. Additionally, implementing security measures is crucial to protect user data and ensure secure communication between microservices.
